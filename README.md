## TUI

Kube Commander UI is based on [termui](https://github.com/gizak/termui).

## Installation

The only way to install kube-commander today is through `go get`:

```bash
go get -u github.com/AnatolyRugalev/kube-commander/cmd/kube-commander
```

Make sure, your `$GOPATH/bin` path persists in `$PATH` env var. Then
launch `kube-commander`.

Have fun!
