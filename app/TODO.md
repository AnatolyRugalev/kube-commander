# TODO

## Major
* Confirmation mechanism (popup/status question)
* Deletion
* Theme editor
  - [X] Widget contains 'Stylable' components
  - [X] Hotkeys to cycle through fg, bg and modifiers of current component
  - [X] Hotkeys to cycle through components inside focused widget
  - [ ] Allow focusing on non-focusable elements: screen, status bar, title bar (hotkeys probably?)
  - [ ] Save / Load themes
* Build default theme
* Status bar flash timer
* Welcome message with hint to read help page

## Minor
* Port-forward in background (Port manager)
* Consider SSH to node support
* List table scrolling arrows
